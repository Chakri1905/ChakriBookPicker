Data Loading:

The required data files are loaded using Pandas' read_csv() function.
Three data files are loaded: Books.csv, Users.csv, and Ratings.csv.
Preprocessing and Exploration:

Various exploratory and preprocessing steps are performed on the loaded data.
The shape of the dataframes (books, ratings, users) is printed to check the number of rows and columns.
Missing values in each dataframe are checked using the isnull().sum() function.
Duplicates in each dataframe are checked using the duplicated().sum() function.
Popularity-Based Recommender System:

Ratings data is merged with the books data using the 'ISBN' column.
The number of ratings for each book is calculated by grouping the data by 'Book-Title' and counting the 'Book-Rating' column.
The average rating for each book is calculated by grouping the data by 'Book-Title' and taking the mean of the 'Book-Rating' column.
The resulting dataframes are merged based on the 'Book-Title' column.
The popular books are selected by filtering books with at least 250 ratings.
The resulting popular books dataframe is merged with the books dataframe to obtain additional information like book author and image URL.
Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender System:

Users with more than 200 ratings are considered as "padhe_likhe_users."
Ratings data is filtered to include only the ratings from "padhe_likhe_users."
Books with at least 50 ratings are considered as "famous_books."
The filtered ratings data is further filtered to include only the ratings for "famous_books."
A pivot table is created with book titles as rows and user IDs as columns, with book ratings as values.
The pivot table is filled with 0s for missing values.
Similarity scores between books are calculated using cosine similarity on the pivot table.
Recommendation Function:

The recommend() function takes a book name as input.
It finds the index of the book in the pivot table.
It calculates the similarity scores between the input book and other books based on the cosine similarity scores.
It returns a list of recommended books, including the book title, author, and image URL.
Saving Data:

The resulting dataframes and similarity scores are saved using the pickle.dump() function.
Summary of Libraries and Functions Used:

Pandas: Used for data manipulation, loading CSV files, and performing exploratory data analysis.
NumPy: Used for various mathematical operations and array manipulation.
sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity: Used to calculate the cosine similarity between books based on the pivot table.
pickle: Used to save the resulting dataframes and similarity scores.
Overall, the book recommendation system includes data loading, preprocessing, popularity-based recommendation, collaborative filtering-based recommendation, and a function to provide book recommendations based on input.
The resulting dataframes and similarity scores are saved using the pickle module for future use.
